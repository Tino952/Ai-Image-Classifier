# Image-Classifier
Image Classifier in Pytorch using pre-trained neural networks (Densenet / VGG)

This project involves reading in a folder of various flower images in order to train a pre-trained neural network from Torchvision. The goal
is to achieve a prediction accuracy exceeding 70%. I have included the python files as well as an ipynb file to Jupyter Notebooks. The order
of the command line scripts is to run train.py followed by predict.py (utilities and model are auxilliary scripts).
